# DCGAN in Tensorflow

This repository contains codes for Tensorflow implementation of [Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) and a jupyter notebook to visualize the results from the generative model. Most of the codes are from [DCGAN-tensorflow](https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow). A trained model with [CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) dataset is also included.


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.5+
- Tensorflow 1.3


## Getting started
